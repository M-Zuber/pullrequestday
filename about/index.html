          What is Pull Request Day?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pull Request day is the last saturday of February, every year since 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a day to encourage newcomers to Open Source contribution to make their
          first Pull Request, and for more experienced contributors to set aside some
          time to give something back.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">
          How does it work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We encourage people to make Pull Requests by publishing the
          <a href="/pledge/">Pull Request Pledge</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We coordinate events (like
          <a href="http://pullrequesthackday.org" target="_blank">Pull Request Hack Day</a>) where
          you can collaborate with others, or get a helping hand from people who have lots of
          experience working on Open Source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're still working this out though - we're actively looking for ideas partners to help us
          reach our goal of <strong>One Milllion Pull Requests in one day</strong>, so please do get in touch - either
          on <a href="http://twitter.com/pullrequestday">Twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:david@openhealthcare.org.uk">emailing</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">
          I think this is great. How can my organisation become a supporter ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We're actively looking for organisations to help us, by promoting the event to their communities, friends, employees etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          We haven't quite worked out the details yet, but we're also thinking about an institutional version of the pledge for
          organisations who employ developers - where they pledge that all of their engineers will make a Pull Request to an Open
          Source project on Pull Request Day. If you're interested and would like to discuss how that would work,
          <a href="mailto:david@openhealthcare.org.uk">drop us a line</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">
          But what if you end up with one million terrible Pull Requests?
        </h3>
        <p>
          That's a valid concern. The last thing we want to do is create unhelpful noise or nuisance pull requests for project
          maintainers who are already overworked and volunteering their time. We think that it's possible to encourage Pull
          Requests that genuinely help though!
        </p>
        <p>
          We're in the process of figuring out some guidelines for this - for how we can ensure that we help Open Source projects
          with new community contributions and inspire people to contribute more. If you have any ideas for how we can guide
          people in this regard, <a href="http://twitter.com/pullrequestday"> drop us a line</a>.
        </p>
